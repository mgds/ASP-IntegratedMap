# ASP-IntegratedMap

This map interface was developed as part of the Academic Seismic Portal of the Marine Geoscience Data System ([MGDS](http://www.marine-geo.org)).  The Academic Seismic Portal (ASP) is sponsored by the National Science Foundation to organize active source seismic field data into a modern relational data management system accessible through the Internet. The system is designed principally for academic scientific use.  This repository contains the components necessary to launch the integrated map interface on any webpage. The map interface relies on web services developed and maintained as part of the [MGDS](http://www.marine-geo.org).
